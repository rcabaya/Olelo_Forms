Feature: Notify	

As an administrator

So that I can be notified via email if there is a submission of forms

I want to know when forms are submitted


Scenario 1

When a customer submits a form online

I should be notified via email 

Then I should see the forms sent


Scenario 2

When a customer submits a form online

I should be able to change who gets notified via email

Then I would be able to forward the email
